## Usage

1. Compile the program using a C compiler.
2. Run the executable.
3. Enter the text for language detection when prompted.

## Features

- Filters the input text and converts it to lowercase.
- Calculates the frequencies of bigrams and trigrams in the text.
- Measures the distances between the calculated frequencies and pre-defined frequency values for English and German.
- Determines the language of the text based on the calculated distances.
